    <h1>Animals on Endangered Species List</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>

        <p>As time goes on, there are more and more species that we have grown up knowing as common animals, that could go extinct. Some
        of these species on the verge of extinction are essential to the habitat they are a part of and if they do go extinct, some of these
        habitats will be endangered as well because the species are taken out of the food chain. Even though there are many animals that are
        on the list, there is a problem that a disproportionate amount of people do not know the animals on the list or how many animals are
        alive in each species. This crucial information is not reaching large amounts of population, so not much can be done to save the
        animals. For example, <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/wildlife/problems/">WWF</a> discusses how we are killing these species
        and the amount of species we are losing. There are other web apps that have attempted to educate people about which species are on
        the endangered species list. There are a lot of different lists on these other web apps and they give an estimate of the remaining
        population of each species.</p>

        <h2>App Description</h2>

        <p>This application is being created in order to give an opportunity to people who care about animals and want to be able to see what
        they can do to help these animals. The users of this web app will be anyone who has a special interest in animals, anyone who wants to
        know about which species are on the endangered species list and anyone who wants to help save endangered species. On this web app, users
        will be viewing a full list of endangered species and the estimate of the population of each species. This information will mainly come
        from <a href="https://awionline.org/content/list-endangered-species?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqr7U2cnZ6AIVl9hkCh1xtAumEAAYASAAEgLFAfD_BwE">Animal
        Welfare Institute</a>.</p>

        <p>For this web app, I would like to implement a few different user interactions. The first being a list of pictures of all the endangered
        species where people can select on a picture and pull up the population number and information of the animal on a new page. I would like users
        to also be able to view all of the human-related causes to making some of these animals endangered. Finally, I would like to allow users to
        create an account for themselves so they may be in contact with other users on the site and collaborate about how they can help the animals
        that are endangered.</p>
