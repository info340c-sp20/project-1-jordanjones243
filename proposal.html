        </header>

        <p>The National Basketball Association is one of the most popular sports in the United States. Many fans love following their favorite
        teams and all of the news that goes along with those teams. Many people love to look at all of the teams' stats, news and information
        on their phones or their computers. While there are certain applications that allow you to see each of the stats, news or other team
        information individually, there is no app that allows you to see all of this in one. For example, 
        <a href="https://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/?sort=W_PCT&dir=-1">NBA Stats</a> shows detailed stats about each NBA team, but it 
        boasts no information about team news, individual player stats or other critical team information.</p>

            <h2>App Description</h2>
        </header>

        <p>This application is being created in order to give an opportunity to fans of the NBA to have one platform that they can get interact
        with to get all of their team information. The users of this web application will be anyone who is a fan of professional basketball
        and users that want to keep updated on what is going on in the basketball world. On this web app, viewers will view team stats that
        will come from the source listed in the previous paragraph, team information such as fan attendance will come from 
        <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/attendance">ESPN</a>, and team details will come from websites about each respective team. There will
        also be news that will be shared on this app that contains information pertaining to the entire NBA, rather than one team.</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>For this web app, I would like to implement a few different user interactions. First, I would like users to be able to view team stats
        on an interactive graph that changes depending on which stat the user selects (e.g. points per game, assissts per game, wins, etc.). Another
        interaction I would like to provide to the users is to go through either the teams or individual players in the NBA and select "favorites" so
        that the users will only see the data from the teams or players they are interested in. In order to implement that interaction, I would have
        users create an account that would allow them to select their favorites and comment on anything posted to their timeline about their favorites. 
        This would allow them to have discussions with other fans about the NBA (something I love to do) or simply to just voice their frustrations or 
        happiness.</p>

        <p>For this web app, I would like to implement a few different user interactions. The first being a list of pictures of all the endangered
        species where people can select on a picture and pull up the population number and information of the animal on a new page. I would like users
        to also be able to view all of the human-related causes to making some of these animals endangered. Finally, I would like to allow users to
        create an account for themselves so they may be in contact with other users on the site and collaborate about how they can help the animals
        that are endangered.</p>
